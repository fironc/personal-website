        <h1>The Road So Far</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Francisco Fierro – a generalist with range, resilience, and a sharp radar for what’s coming next. I work with founders and startups to help them grow smarter and execute faster.</p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>Over the last decade, I’ve worked across consulting, asset management, government, tech, and small business. I’ve helped startups raise capital, built internal policies, led product marketing efforts, and run operations. I also ran my own e-commerce business and earned my MBA at Duke – graduating in the top 10% of my class while raising a family.</p>
        <p>My biggest failure? Not being able to stay in the U.S. after my MBA. It taught me the importance of clarity, communication, and sharing your value proposition in a way that resonates. Since then, I’ve been focused on execution, building real relationships, and helping others do the same.</p>

        <h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
        <p>I’m obsessed with figuring out how things work—especially people, products, and systems. I connect dots fast, think cross-functionally, and I’m known for turning complex problems into clear next steps. I geek out on tech, strategy, business books, history, memes, and even 90s games like Rollercoaster Tycoon and Age of Empires. I also love sports—especially Duke basketball—more than most people I know.</p>
        <p>Whether it's refining your pitch, aligning your internal processes, or taking an idea from zero to one (or three), I’m here to help make things sharper and more actionable.</p>

        <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Deep experience across multiple industries – from tech to consumer goods, with a solid foundation in finance.</li>
            <li>A blend of strategy and execution – I don’t just advise, I follow through and implement.</li>
            <li>Global perspective, strong problem-solving skills, and a bias for action.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you’re building something exciting—or trying to fix something that’s stuck—<a href="contact.html">let’s talk</a>.</p>
