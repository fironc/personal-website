        <h1>The Road So Far</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Francisco Fierro – a problem solver that wants to help startups and founders grow. Experienced in multiple industries, I specialize in turning insights into execution.</p>
        
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>From consulting and financial risk analysis to running an e-commerce business and pitching VCs, my journey has been a mix of strategy, execution, and hands-on business growth.</p>
        <p>I've helped startups raise money, companies get sold, set-up internal policies, and managed projects to enable execution.</p>
        
        <h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
        <p>Helping others go from zero to one, two, and three. I want more startups and small companies to navigate growth, optimize their current strategy executing it efficiently. Whether it’s refining messaging, optimizing distribution, or streamlining workflows, I focus on delivering results.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Deep experience across multiple industries – from tech to consumer goods, with a pinch of finance in between.</li>
            <li>A blend of strategy and execution – I don’t just advise, I follow through implementation.</li>
            <li>Strong problem-solving skills with a global perspective.</li>
        </ul>
